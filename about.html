          <h2>BIO</h2>
          <p class="about">My name is Seth March and I am an aspiring developer. I graduated High School in 2005 and joined the US Army in 2007. While in the military I was a Signals Intelligence Analyst assigned to the National Security Agency and served a tour in Iraq. After my contract was up, I continued working for the Agency as a contractor and worked at Fort Gordon for a year and spent 2 years in Afghanistan. I am the oldest of six children and have 3 children of my own. I love playing bass guitar, hunting, shooting and gaming. My drive for being a developer came from the enjoyment of problem solving and and the fulfillment of overcoming challenges.</p>
