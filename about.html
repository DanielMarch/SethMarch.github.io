        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p class="about">My name is Seth March and I am an aspiring Web Developer in training at the Nashville Software School. I graduated High School in 2005 and joined the US Army in 2007. While in the military, I was a Signals Intelligence Analyst assigned to the National Security Agency at Fort Meade and served a tour in Iraq. After my enlistment was up, I continued working for the Agency as a contractor and worked at Fort Gordon for a year and spent 2 years in Afghanistan. I am the oldest of six brothers and have 3 children of my own along with a beautiful wife. I love playing bass guitar, hunting, shooting and gaming. My drive for becoming a web developer stems from my years of experience in critical thinking and problem solving and transitioning my skills to a civilian career.</p>
